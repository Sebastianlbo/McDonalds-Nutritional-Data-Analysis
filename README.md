## McDonald's Menu Nutritional Analysis

### Overview

Welcome to the McDonald's Menu Nutritional Analysis project! In this personal endeavor, I set out to explore the comprehensive nutritional composition of McDonald's menu items, aiming to identify patterns and trends within the data. It is essential to note that this project is entirely original, undertaken without external guidance, and all information was acquired through independent research and interactions with ChatGPT.

### Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to delve into the nutritional aspects of McDonald's menu items. The analysis encompasses the distribution of macronutrients, micronutrients, overall calorie content, and the relationships between these components. To provide a more quantitative understanding, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to quantify correlations, offering a nuanced perspective on the nutritional dynamics of the menu.

### Data Sources 

All information used in this project was obtained from publicly available sources on the internet. The primary dataset was sourced from Kaggle and can be found here. Insights were generated through interactions with ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI.
